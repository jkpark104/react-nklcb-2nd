      In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a
      style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that
      expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
      Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side
      effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the
      problem domain, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of
      the programming language primitives (the how being left up to the
      language&apos;s implementation). This is in contrast with imperative
      programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.
